  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hello! I'm Banana Expert assistant. How can I assist you today?"

  utter_goodbye:
    - text: "Goodbye! If you have more questions, feel free to ask."

  utter_ask_cultivation_steps:
    - text: "Sure, here are the basic steps for banana cultivation:\n
        1. Choose the right banana variety.\n
        2. Prepare the soil and plant the banana sucker.\n
        3. Provide adequate water and nutrients.\n
        4. Control pests and diseases.\n
        5. Harvest ripe bananas."

  utter_ask_disease_prevention:
    - text: "To prevent banana diseases, you can:\n
        1. Keep the area clean and free of debris.\n
        2. Use disease-resistant banana varieties.\n
        3. Apply appropriate fungicides when necessary."

  utter_provide_banana_diseases:
    - text: "Here are some common banana diseases:\n
        1. Cordana\n
        2. Black Sigatoka\n
        3. Anthracnose\n
        4. Crown Rot\n
        5. Panama Disease (Tropical Race 4)"

  utter_disease_cordana:
    - text: "Based on the symptoms you described, it appears to be Cordana."

  utter_disease_black_sigatoka:
    - text: "Based on the symptoms you described, it appears to be Black Sigatoka (Black Leaf Streak)."

  utter_disease_anthracnose:
    - text: "Based on the symptoms you described, it appears to be Anthracnose."

  utter_disease_crownrot:
    - text: "Based on the symptoms you described, it appears to be Crownrot."

  utter_cordana_symptoms:
    - text: "Cordana (Cordana Leaf Spot) symptoms:\n
        1. Leaf Spots: Circular to elliptical spots with dark brown margins and light gray centers may appear on the leaves. These spots are typically between 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter.\n
        2. Streaks: In some cases, long, dark streaks may develop along the leaves, often following the veins.\n
        3. Concentric Rings: Concentric rings can be seen within the spots on the leaves.\n
        4. Leaf Death: As the disease progresses, the leaves can die and wither, leading to reduced photosynthesis and ultimately affecting the overall health of the plant."

  utter_blacksigatoka_symptoms:
    - text: "Black Sigatoka (Black Leaf Streak) symptoms:\n
        1. Leaf Spots: Circular to elongated dark brown or black spots with yellow halos appear on the banana leaves. These spots can vary in size but often start as small lesions.\n
        2. Spore Production: A dark velvety growth may develop on the undersides of infected leaves. This is the spore-producing structure of the Black Sigatoka fungus.\n
        3. Coalescing Spots: Over time, the individual spots may coalesce, forming large areas of dead tissue on the leaves.\n
        4. Reduced Photosynthesis: As the disease progresses, the affected leaves become less effective in photosynthesis. This can result in reduced growth and yield of the banana plant.\n
        5. Leaf Death: In severe cases, the leaves may wither and die, affecting the overall health of the plant."

  utter_anthracnose_symptoms:
    - text: "Anthracnose symptoms:\n
        1. Lesions on Leaves: Small, sunken, dark lesions or spots with red, orange, or tan centers may appear on banana leaves.\n
        2. Lesions on Fruits: Dark, sunken spots with pinkish centers can develop on banana fruits, making them unmarketable.\n
        3. Cankers on Pseudostems: Dark, cracked, and sunken areas may form on the pseudostems (the part of the plant that looks like a trunk).\n
        4. Rotting of Inflorescences: Anthracnose can cause the rotting of banana flower structures (inflorescences), which can lead to fruit loss."

  utter_crownrot_symptoms:
    - text: "Crown Rot symptoms:\n
        1. Leaf Wilting: The leaves of the banana plant may wilt, turn yellow, or exhibit overall poor growth.\n
        2. Dark Lesions on Stem Bases: Dark, sunken lesions or streaks may appear on the stem bases, especially at or near the soil line.\n
        3. Soft and Slimy Tissue: The affected areas may become soft, slimy, and unpleasant smelling.\n
        4. Root Rot: Crown rot can also affect the roots, leading to rotting and poor nutrient uptake."
